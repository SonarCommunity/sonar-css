## Description
This plugin enables code QA analysis of CSS files within [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org):

 * Computes metrics: lines of code, number of rules, complexity, etc.
 * Validates your CSS code
 * Performs more than [50 checks](#available-checks)
 * Provides the ability to write your own checks

 
## Usage
1. [Download and install](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Setup+and+Upgrade) SonarQube
2. Install the CSS plugin either by a [direct download](https://github.com/SonarQubeCommunity/sonar-css/releases) or through the [update center](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Update+Center).
3. Install your [favorite analyzer](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+Source+Code#AnalyzingSourceCode-RunningAnalysis) (SonarQube Scanner, Maven, Ant, etc.) and analyze your code. Note that starting at version 2.0, Java 8 is required to run an analysis.

## Metrics

### Functions
Number of rules.

### Complexity
The following elements increment the complexity by one:

* Class selector
* ID selector
* Attribute selector
* Type selector
* Pseudo selector
* Keyframes selector
* At-rule

### Complexity/function
It computes the complexity/rule, meaning the average number of selectors per rule. It gives a measurement on how specific the selectors are.

## Custom Checks

You're thinking of new valuable rules? Version 2.1 or greater provides an API to write your own custom checks.
A sample plugin with detailed explanations is available [here](https://github.com/racodond/sonar-css-custom-rules-plugin).
If your custom rules may benefit the community, feel free to create a pull request in order to make the rule available in the CSS plugin.

You're thinking of new rules that may benefit the community but don't have the time or the skills to write them? Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/SonarQubeCommunity/sonar-css/issues) for your rules to be taken under consideration.
